title: Experiences Leading Teams

I'm a big believer in **Autonomy**, **Mastery** and **Purpose**. As such, I
pride myself in building strongly **aligned**, highly **skilled** and highly
**motivated** teams.

My recent experiences around **alignment** have come from the implementation
of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Simple on the outside, OKRs have an
incredibly large dependency on an organisation's Mission, Vision and Values.
I solicited collaboration from CEO to each individual contributor (IC) to
set company, department, functional area and, often individual OKRs. These
quarterly measured goals are not for performance management, but give **Purpose**
to each IC and allow decisions and direction to tightly correlate with
neighbouring teams, management and executive expectations.

Highly **skilled** teams develop, they don't simply exist. It's possible to
recruit the top end engineers with a wealth of knowledge and experience,
however, I aim to provide an environment that nurtures experimentation, failure
and, individual growth. Building teams with a mix of mentors and less
experienced ICs has and does pay dividends. Primarily, I look to recruit hungry
ICs, ICs in the pursuit of **Mastery**.

Finally, an intrinsically **motivated** team is one that is content in their
environment. They have no concerns about asking questions, challenging the status
quo or taking on the responsibilities of ownership. This motivation - in my
experience - comes in the form of **Autonomy**. This autonomy, under the guidance of
highly skilled and strongly aligned teams enables incredible scale and delivery for
software products.

On a micro level I find communication to be key in setting the above cultural traits.
Using a combination of manager, peer, report and grand-report 1o1s an organisation
can set a regular cadence about which a culture and direction can be nurtured
ensuring highly efficient engineering divisions.
