title: List of Blogs/Posts/Videos/Podcasts/Other

Updated: December 18th, 2013

I always read blog posts, listen to podcasts and watch videos in an attempt to
keep up to date with technology and the web. It’s hard to stay on the cutting
edge, it’s even harder to get there in the first place. Below is a list of
posts/videos/podcasts that I've found interesting over the years. The majority
of them should be timeless.

There's also a few bits at the end that I just like being reminded of. Useful
things!

It's also worth noting that some of these blog posts have contradicting views.
This isn't to say that I *follow* or *believe* all of the below. These are articles
that I've found useful in progressing myself in this industry.
